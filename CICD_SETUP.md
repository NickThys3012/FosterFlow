# CI/CD Setup — Manual Steps

These are the one-time manual steps to make the three GitHub Actions workflows
(`build.yml`, `docker-build.yml`, `deploy.yml`) fully operational. The workflow
files and Dockerfile are already in the repo — these steps cover the configuration
that can only be done outside the codebase.

| Workflow | File | Trigger | Needs setup? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Build & Test | `.github/workflows/build.yml` | push `develop`/`main`, PRs to `main` | No (works out of the box) |
| Docker Build & Push | `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` | after **Build & Test** succeeds on `main` | Optional (GHCR visibility) |
| Deploy to Azure | `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` | after **Docker Build & Push** succeeds on `main` | **Yes — secret required** |

> **Chained execution:** on a push to `main` the workflows run **sequentially** —
> `Build & Test` → `Docker Build & Push` → `Deploy` — using GitHub's `workflow_run`
> trigger. Each stage only starts if the previous one succeeded, so production is
> never released before build, tests and the image push have all passed. Each can
> still be run on its own via **Run workflow** (`workflow_dispatch`).
>
> ⚠️ `workflow_run` chaining only works once these workflow files exist on the
> **default branch** (`main`). The chain won't trigger from a feature branch or PR —
> merge to `main` first.

## 1. Add the Azure publish profile secret (required for deploy)

The deploy workflow authenticates to App Service `app-fosterflow-prod-swe` using a
publish profile stored as the secret `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE`.

### a. Download the publish profile

**Azure Portal:** App Services → `app-fosterflow-prod-swe` → **Overview** →
**Download publish profile**. Save the `.PublishSettings` file.

**Or via Azure CLI:**

```bash
az webapp deployment list-publishing-profiles \
  --name app-fosterflow-prod-swe \
  --resource-group rg-fosterflow-prod-swe \
  --xml > publish-profile.xml
```

### b. Add it as a GitHub secret

**Via GitHub UI:** Repo → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** →
**New repository secret**.
- Name: `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE`
- Value: paste the **entire** contents of the downloaded XML file.

**Or via GitHub CLI:**

```bash
gh secret set AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE < publish-profile.xml
```

### c. Clean up

```bash
rm publish-profile.xml   # never commit the publish profile
```

> The publish profile contains deployment credentials. Keep it only in GitHub Secrets.

## 1b. Set the App Service startup command (required — fixes default landing page)

A hosted Blazor publish produces **two** `*.runtimeconfig.json` files
(`FosterFlow.Api` + `FosterFlow.Web`). App Service's Oryx can't auto-pick the entry
DLL and falls back to its default landing page. Pin the startup command to
`dotnet FosterFlow.Api.dll`.

This is now baked into the Bicep (`infra/modules/appservice.bicep` →
`appCommandLine`), so a fresh `infra` deploy sets it automatically. For the
**existing** App Service, apply it once now:

```bash
az webapp config set \
  --name app-fosterflow-prod-swe \
  --resource-group rg-fosterflow-prod-swe \
  --startup-file "dotnet FosterFlow.Api.dll"

az webapp restart \
  --name app-fosterflow-prod-swe \
  --resource-group rg-fosterflow-prod-swe
```

Then re-check:

```bash
curl -i https://app-fosterflow-prod-swe.azurewebsites.net/health   # expect 200
```



`deploy.yml` references `environment: production`. Creating it lets you scope the
secret, add protection rules, and see deployment history.

**Settings** → **Environments** → **New environment** → name it `production`.

- (Optional) Move `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE` here as an *environment* secret
  instead of a repo secret for tighter scoping.
- Leave "Required reviewers" **off** — issue #43 requires automatic deploys with no
  manual approval. (Turn it on later if you want a manual gate.)

---

## 3. Branch protection on `main` (required by #41)

So failing builds can't be merged.

**Settings** → **Branches** → **Add branch ruleset** (or **Add rule**) for `main`:

- ✅ Require a pull request before merging
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
  - Add the check: **`Build & Test`** (appears after the workflow runs once)
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging

**Or via GitHub CLI:**

```bash
gh api -X PUT repos/NickThys3012/FosterFlow/branches/main/protection \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -f "required_status_checks[strict]=true" \
  -f "required_status_checks[contexts][]=Build & Test" \
  -F "enforce_admins=true" \
  -F "required_pull_request_reviews[required_approving_review_count]=1" \
  -F "restrictions=null"
```

> The `Build & Test` check only becomes selectable after the workflow has run at
> least once (push a commit or open a PR first).

---

## 4. GHCR image visibility (optional, for `docker-build.yml`)

The Docker workflow pushes to `ghcr.io/nickthys3012/fosterflow` using the built-in
`GITHUB_TOKEN` — **no secret needed**. After the first push:

- The package appears under your GitHub profile/org → **Packages**.
- By default it is **private**. To pull it without auth (e.g. `docker run
  ghcr.io/nickthys3012/fosterflow:latest`), open the package → **Package settings**
  → **Change visibility** → **Public**.
- Ensure **Settings** → **Actions** → **General** → **Workflow permissions** allows
  *Read and write permissions* (the workflow also sets `packages: write` explicitly).

---

## 5. First run & verification

1. Merge/push these changes to `main`.
2. Watch the **Actions** tab — the workflows run **in sequence**:
   `Build & Test` → (on success) `Docker Build & Push` → (on success) `Deploy to
   Azure App Service`. If any stage fails, the chain stops and production is not
   updated.
3. Verify the deploy:

   ```bash
   curl -i https://app-fosterflow-prod-swe.azurewebsites.net/health   # expect 200
   curl -I https://app-fosterflow-prod-swe.azurewebsites.net/          # expect 200 (HTML)
   ```

4. Verify the image (after making it public, or `docker login ghcr.io` first):

   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/nickthys3012/fosterflow:latest
   ```

## Notes

- **Database migrations run automatically at startup:** the API calls
  `MigrateDatabaseAsync()` before seeding, so a freshly provisioned Azure SQL
  database gets its schema applied on first boot. No separate CI migration step or
  DB firewall opening is needed (the App Service reaches SQL as an Azure service).
- **Database connection at runtime:** the App Service supplies
  `ConnectionStrings__Database` from Key Vault (see `infra/`). The published app
  requires it to start — that is expected.
- **Running the container locally** needs a SQL connection string; use
  `docker-compose.yml` (which starts SQL + a migrator) rather than a bare
  `docker run`.
- **Rollback:** App Service keeps the previous deployment; use the portal
  (Deployment Center → redeploy a prior commit) or deployment slots to roll back.
- **Region/naming:** workflows target your actual infra
  (`app-fosterflow-prod-swe`, swedencentral), not the placeholder
  `fosterflow-api.azurewebsites.net` from the issue text.
